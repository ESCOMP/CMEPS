================================
 CMEPS application specific code
================================

For each supported application, CMEPS contains two specific files that determine:

* the allowed field names in the mediator and aliases for those names that the components might have
* the fields that are exchanged between components
* how source fields are mapped to destination fields
* how source fields are merged after mapping to destination fields

Three application specific versions are currently contained within CMEPS:

* for CESM: **esmFldsExchange_cesm_mod.F90** and **fd_cesm.yaml**
* for UFS-S2S: **esmFldsExchange_nems_mod.F90** and **fd_nems.yaml**
* for UFS-HAFS: **esmFldsExchange_hafs_mod.F90** and **fd_hafs.yaml**

CMEPS advertises **all possible fields** that can be imported to and
exported by the mediator for the target coupled system. Not all of
these fields will be connected to the various components. The
connections will be determined by what the components advertise in
their respective advertise phase.

Across applications, component-specific names for the same fields may vary. The field 
dictionary is used to define how the application or component-specific name relates
to the name that the CMEPS mediator uses for that field. The mediator variable 
names and their application specific aliases are found in the YAML field dictionary. 

Details of the naming conventions and API's of this file can be found
in the description of the :ref:`exchange of fields in
CMEPS<api-for-esmflds>`.

Field Naming Convention
-----------------------

The CMEPS field name convention in the YAML files is independent of the model components.
The convention differentiates between variables that are state fields versus flux fields.
The naming convention assumes the following one letter designation for the various components as
well as the mediator. 

**import to mediator**::

  a => atmosphere
  i => sea-ice
  l => land
  g => land-ice
  o => ocean
  r => river
  w => wave

**export from mediator (after  mapping and merging)**::

  x => mediator

**State Variables**:

  State variables have a 3 character prefix followed by the state
  name. The prefix has the form ``S[a,i,l,g,o,r,w,x]_`` and is followed by
  the field name. 
  
  As an example, ``Sx_t`` is the merged surface
  temperature from land, ice and ocean sent to the atmosphere for CESM.

**Flux variables**:

  Flux variables specify both source and destination components and have a 
  5 character prefix followed by an identifier name of the flux. The first 5 
  characters of the flux prefix ``Flmn_`` indicate a flux between 
  components l and m, computed by component n. The flux-prefix is followed 
  by the relevant flux-name. 
  
  **mediator import flux prefixes**::
  
    Faxa_, atm flux computed by atm
    Fall_, lnd-atm flux computed by lnd
    Fioi_, ice-ocn flux computed by ice
    Faii_, ice_atm flux computed by ice
    Flrr_, lnd-rof flux computed by rof
    Firr_, rof-ice flux computed by rof
	
  **mediator export flux prefixes**::
  
    Faxx_, mediator merged fluxes sent to the atm
    Foxx_, mediator merged fluxes sent to the ocn
    Fixx_, mediator merged fluxes sent to the ice

Exchange of fields
------------------

The application specific module, ``esmFldsExchange_xxx.F90`` contains
all of the information to determine how the mediator performs the
exchange of fields between components. In particular, this module uses the subroutines
``addfld``, ``addmap`` and ``addmrg`` to do the following:

* ``addfld`` advertises all possible fields that the mediator can send
  to and receive from each component that is part of the target
  application

* ``addmap`` determines how each source field is mapped from its
  source mesh to a target destinations mesh. Note that a given source
  field may be mapped to more than one destination meshes and so there
  can be more than one call to ``addmap`` for that source field.

* ``addmrg`` determines how a collection of mapped source fields
  is merged to the target destination field.

.. note:: In all these functions, specific components are accessed using a comp_index, where comp_index can be any of [compatm, compice, compglc, complnd, compocn, comprof, compwav].

This section describes the API for the calls that determine the above
information. All of the API's discussed below use the code in the
generic module ``esmFlds.F90``.

.. _addfld:

`addfld`
~~~~~~~~~~
CMEPS advertises all possible fields that it can receive from a component or send to any component via a call to ``addfld``.
The API for this call is:

.. code-block:: Fortran

   call addfld(fldListFr(comp_index)%flds, 'field_name')
   call addfld(fldListTo(comp_index)%flds, 'field_name')   

where:

* ``comp_index`` is the component index

* ``'field_name'`` is the field name that will be advertised

.. _addmap:

`addmap`
~~~~~~~~~~
CMEPS determines how to map each source field from its source mesh to a target destination mesh via a call to ``addmap``.
The API for this call is:

.. code-block:: Fortran

   call addmap(FldListFr(comp_index_src)%flds, 'field_name', comp_index_dst, maptype, mapnorm, mapfile)

where

* ``comp_index_src`` is the  source component index

* ``comp_index_dst`` is the  destination component index

* **maptype** determines the mapping type and can have values of:

  * ``mapbilnr``: bilinear mapping

  * ``mapconsf``: first order conservative mapping with normalization type of conservative fraction.

  * ``mapconsd``: first order conservative mapping with normalization type of conservative fraction.

  * ``mappatch``: patch mapping

  * ``mapfcopy``: redist mapping

  * ``mapnstod``: nearest source to destination mapping

  * ``mapnstod_consd``: nearest source to destination followed by conservative destination

  * ``mapnstod_consf``: nearest source to destination followed by conservative fraction

.. _normalization:

* **mapnorm** determines the mapping normalization and can have values of:

  * ``unset`` : no normalization is set, should only be used if maptype is 'mapfcopy'

  * ``none``  : no normalization is done, should only be used if maptype is not 'mapfcopy'

  * ``one``   : normalize by 1. (see description below for normalization)

  * ``lfrin`` : normalize by the ``lfrin`` field in FBFrac(complnd). Used to map lnd->atm (see description of :ref:`fractions<fractions>`).

  * ``ifrac`` : normalize by the 'ifrac' field in FBFrac(compice). Used to map ice->atm (see description of :ref:`fractions<fractions>`).

  * ``ofrac`` : normalize by the 'ofrac' field in FBFrac(compocn). Used to map ice->atm (see description of :ref:`fractions<fractions>`).

  * ``custom`` : custom mapping and normalization will be done in the prep phase for the corresponding field (used to map glc->lnd).

  .. note:: When **mapnorm** is used, the field will first be scaled by the relevant ``FBfrac`` before mapping and then unscaled by the same ``FBfrac`` after mapping. For example, when ``ifrac`` is the normalization, the field will be scaled by ``FBfrac(compice)[ifrac]`` before mapping and unscaled by the mapped ``FBFrac(compice)[ifrac]`` after mapping.

* **mapfile**  determines if a mapping file will be read in or the route handle will be generated at run time:

  * ``unset``  : online route handles will be generated

  * ``mapfile``: read in corresponding full pathname. The ``<filename>`` is obtained as an attribute from the driver

**Normalization** :
Fractional normalization is needed to improve the accuracy field exchanges between ice and ocean and atmosphere. Consider the case where one cell has an ice
fraction of 0.3 and the other has a fraction of 0.5. Mapping the ice fraction to the atmospheric cell results in a value of 0.4. If the same temperatures are
mapped in the same way, a temperature of -1.5 results which is reasonable, but not entirely accurate. Because of the relative ice fractions, the weight of the
second cell should be greater than the weight of the first cell. Taking this into account properly results in a fraction weighted ice temperature of -1.625 in
this example. This is the fraction correction that is carried out whenever ocean and ice fields are mapped to the atmosphere grid. Note that time varying
fraction corrections are not required in other mappings to improve accuracy because their relative fractions remain static.

**Example** :

.. code-block:: Fortran

   call addmap(fldListFr(compice)%flds, 'Si_snowh', compatm, mapconsf, 'ifrac', 'unset')

This will create an entry in ``fldListFr(compatm)`` specifying that the ``Si_snowh`` field from the ice should be mapped conservatively to the atmosphere using
fractional normalization where the ice fraction is obtained from ``FBFrac(compice)[snowh]``. The route handle for this mapping will be created at run time. 

.. _addmrg:

`addmrg`
~~~~~~~~~~
CMEPS determines how to map a set of one or more mapped source fields to create the target destination field in the export state.
The API for this call is:

.. code-block:: Fortran

   call addmrg(fldListTo(comp_index_dst)%flds, dst_fieldname, &
               mrg_from1, mrg_fld1, mrg_type1, mrg_fracname1, &
               mrg_from2, mrg_fld2, mrg_type2, mrg_fracname2, &
               mrg_from3, mrg_fld3, mrg_type3, mrg_fracname3, &
               mrg_from4, mrg_fld4, mrg_type4, mrg_fracname4)

where

* ``mrg_fromN``, ``mrgfldN``, ``mrgtypeN`` and ``mrg_fracnameN``, where ``N=[1,2,3,4]``, are optional arguments.
  ``mrgfrom1`` is corresponds to the first source component index (e.g. ``compatm``).

* **mrg_fromN**: is an integer corresponding to the source component index

* **mrg_fldN** : is a character string corresponding to the field name in the mapped field bundle of the source component with index ``mrg_fromN``

* **mrg_typeN**: the type of merging that will be carried out for component with index ``mrg_fromN``. The allowed values are:

  * ``copy``: simply copy the source mapped field into the destination field bundle

  * ``copy_with_weights``: weight the mapped source field by its fraction on the destination mesh.

  * ``sum_with_weights``: do a cumulative sum of all the mapped source fields where each field is weighed by by its fraction on the destination mesh.

  * ``sum_with_weights``: do a cumulative sum of all the mapped source fields.

For ``copy_with_weights`` and ``sum_with_weights``, the mapped source field is weighted by ``mrg_fracnameN`` in ``FBFrac(comp_index_dst)``. If
copy_with_weights is chose as the ``mrg_typeN`` value then ``mrg_fracnameN`` is also required as an argument. If sum_with_weights is chose as the ``mrg_typeN``
value then ``mrg_fracnameN`` is also required as an argument.
